Summary

This project analyzes employee payroll distribution, departmental salary concentration, performance-based compensation trends, and the financial impact of a company-wide raise using MySQL 8.0.

The objective is to evaluate cost structure, compensation fairness, and financial sustainability.


***The company has a monthly salary obligation of 104,300, totaling 1,251,600 annually. This highlights the significance of payroll as a fixed operational cost and the importance of cash flow planning.


***IT has the highest payroll allocation, indicating a technology-focused workforce.Marketing has the lowest payroll, suggesting lean staffing or lower salary bands.This distribution highlights departmental cost concentration and operational priorities.


***Finance has the highest-paid individual, but IT has the largest overall payroll burden.This shows that high salaries are concentrated in Finance, while IT has more mid-to-high salary employees, reflecting workforce composition.


***Salary does not strictly increase with performance rating.Employees with rating 3 have the highest average salary, suggesting compensation may depend on seniority, role, or department rather than performance alone.


***Jane Smith had the highest earning with  6,500, followed by Liam Neumann with 6,400 suggesting that,high earners are concentrated in specific roles and departments, impacting payroll distribution and department-level cost burden.


*** An 8% company-wide raise increases monthly payroll by 8,344 and annual payroll by 100,128.This demonstrates that even moderate raises have a measurable financial impact, emphasizing the need for strategic payroll planning.
